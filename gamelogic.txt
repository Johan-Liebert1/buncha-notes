There are three classes in this program.

1. Mastermind class
This is the entry point of the program and contains the main function. It initializes a Controller object 'c', which is
used to control the gameplay. Not the game logic, but the gameplay

2. Controller Class
This class controls the gameplay such as taking the player's guess, calling the Game.evaluate() function to evaluate the guess,
and then provide the user with feedback on their guess. It also tells them how many turns they've got left. It checks if the 
user has exceeded the stipulated amount of allowed guesses and terminates the game if that's the case. Then it will prompt 
the user if they would want to play a new game or not and handles the condition accordingly.

3. Game Class
This class contains all the game logic such as generating a random code, evaluating player's guess against the code. It can be 
thought as a helper class, that the controller class uses.
